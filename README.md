# Project-Team-Computing
This project aims to allow a robot built by our team
to safely navigate a maze full of black squares signifying
mines which will end the attempt the robot needs to "know"
its position in relation to the grid and be able to get the first 
objective return to the start point go back out retrieve the second
objective and return the fastest possible way.
